    "text": "Introduction\nProduct Page | Shop Page\n\nHEar allows faithful reproduction of a stereo or surround mix with a pair of conventional stereo headphones. It relies on proven technology to model the various phenomena that occur when playing back audio material through a loudspeaker system.\nThis allows monitoring a full surround mix in situations when a surround-capable environment is not available or practical. Another typical use of HEar is doing precise checking of a mix, which is convenient with headphones as these provide a ‘surgical’ and very detailed, microscope-like rendering of the audio.\nIt can also prove very useful in a project studio context, and whenever noise isolation is a concern, as it helps achieving a more realistic sound environment."

    "text": "Auditory scene perception\nOur perception of sound mainly relies on our ability to identify and characterize a number of sound sources, depending on the spatial parameters of these sources, such as apparent position and size.\nThe duplex localization theory developed by Lord Rayleigh in 1907, claims two factors are predominant to characterize perception, namely the differences in arrival time (ITD) and intensity (ILD) between sounds reaching our ears. Perceived sound variations between ears are mainly attributed to the head obstructing sound waves and therefore forcing them to travel around the head in order to reach the opposite-facing ear.\nSubsequent studies have confirmed and refined this theory which has prevailed ever since its introduction more than a century ago."

    "text": "Localisation\nThe ITD and ILD localization indexes are derived from measurements of the transfer function between the sound source’s origin, taken at a certain incidence, and the listener’s eardrums. The transfer function summarize the transformations the sound goes through before reaching the listener, including diffraction, diffusion and reflection on the listener’s body and head.\nThese measurements are commonly referred to as HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function)."

    "text": "Binaural technology\nBinaural technology encompasses methods for recording, processing, synthesizing and reproducing sound that are specifically designed to preserve tridimensional localisation properties.\nIn order to mimic the impression of a sound originating from a given incidence, it is sufficient to filter a mono signal, which on its own lacks any kind of spatial information, with both left and right HRTF filters. This constitutes the foundation of binaural synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that the resulting signal is only meant to be listened to with headphones, and isn’t designed for a conventional stereo loudspeaker setup."

HEar automatically adjusts its I/O configuration based on what the hosts reports to the plugin. Some hosts such as Logic do not report this correctly or do not support asymmetric I/O configurations In this case you have to do this manually and select amongst a number of choices of symmetric (N-to-N) and asymmetric I/O (N to stereo).\n\n\nOptions\nThese are best left at their default in most cases, but can be changed if required:\n\nDisable processing during bypass: stops processing completely during bypass. Allows to conserve CPU when using many instances and a lot of bypass on/off automation, such as film or sound effects mixing. Default is off (enabled).\nUse Multi-Thread Automation: dedicate a separate thread for automation. Useful when heavy automation is present in the project to get rid of possible audio dropouts. Default is off (processing and automation share the same thread).\nTry to avoid latency as possible: minimize latency by employing minimal buffering, possibly at the expense of a little CPU overhead. Default is on.\nReport latency: report plugin latency, if any, to the host. Some hosts have difficulty coping with large latency values, in this case you can force the plugin to report zero, but you’ll have to manually compensate for this for tracks to remain synced. Default is on (report true latency)."
