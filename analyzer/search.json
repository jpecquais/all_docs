Lower values lead to faster apparent display update rates, while higher values smooth-out any time-variations more. Default is 32.\n\nRunning average employs a weighting window that gives more importance to the last incoming blocks of samples. This type of time averaging is also called moving average, rolling average or running average, and is good for smoothing out abrupt variations in time and still be able to monitor in a continuous fashion. Fill-freeze mode is useful for stabilizing a flickering display while still following long-term variations, which permits a more detailed study of the curve(s). This mode is therefore useful to get a very steady picture of the spectrum while still monitoring some of the mid-term changes, and saves you from holding and resetting the display manually again and again."

Depending on your soundcard, you might be able to change this to a different value directly in Pure Analyzer without opening its control panel beforehand. Smaller buffer sizes leads to a shorter latency between incoming audio, display update, and audio output. This setting is certainly not as crucial as in the context of live sound processing, so there is no need to go down to extremely small values here, as this only increases the system load without offering any practical advantage.\nKeep in mind a display refresh rate of 60Hz means one frame lasts for approx. 16ms, which is a bit longer than one 512 buffer at 44.1kHz, so the display will always lag less than one frame after the audio with such a setting."

Transforming an audio signal onto a frequency scale is indeed of great interest in a wide range of tasks, and notably allows to display a global, perceptually meaningful and precise picture of the audio contents.\nThe display represents the so-called magnitude spectrum of the incoming signal, which is a two-dimensional curve of the magnitudes of the signal taken at frequencies ranging from 0 (DC) to half that of the current sampling rate (or Nyquist frequency in signal processing jargon).

This value constitutes a good compromise between precision and responsiveness for most situations.

    "text": "The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is the traditional method employed to compute the frequency spectrum of a discrete digital signal. DFT can be seen as a series of notch filters centered around frequency bins that are uniformly distributed along the frequency axis, and of constant width.\nThe quality factor of a resonant filter, commonly denoted as Q, is defined as the ratio of its bandwidth relative to its center frequency. The DFT process is therefore analogous to a variable Q filter-bank: in other words, its frequency resolution is constant across the spectrum. When applied to sliding blocks, this process is called STFT, for Short-term Fourier transform.\nAlthough convenient in terms of computation, this can be seen as less than ideal for many audio applications, for several reasons, the first and foremost being that human perception of frequency is known to be quasi-logarithmic. Logarithmic means that a two-fold increase in frequency translates to a one octave shift, a four-fold increase as a two-octave shift - and not four as this would be the case, were our perception linear in nature.\nPure Analyzer employs both standard DFT and proprietary algorithms that more closely model the human perception. In addition to greatly improving the legibility of the resulting curves, this proprietary transform has the additional benefit of reducing sensitivity to noise in the high-frequency portion of the spectrum especially, and provides more stable readouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can of course switch back to standard DFT by disengaging the Pure spectrum button."

Also, note that plain DFT corresponds to scaling set to amplitude.\nThe power of a time-signal is proportional to the square of its amplitude, or equivalently, its power in dB is double the amplitude. However, in the case of a spectrum, we are measuring the output of a filter-bank, which reacts very much differently depending on the type of input signal, so the simple previous formula doesn’t apply anymore."

This common and widely used rule is however not entirely sufficient, as the digital and analog processing involved in a D/A converter does not guarantee that a 0dBfs peak signal will exactly translate to a 0dB peak in the analog domain.\nWithout getting into too much detail, this phenomenon can be attributed to the over-sampling and reconstruction filters present in the D/A convertors, whose role are to rebuild a continuous time signal from a set of discrete digital values sampled at regularly spaced time intervals. This interpolation process can therefore generate values which lie above 0dB, which is known as overshoot.\nRelying solely on the peak value of samples can lead to the following problems:\n\nInconsistent readings between successive playbacks of the same material.\nUnexpected overloads of the D/A output converter.\nUnder-readings and beating of pure tones.\n\nTruePeak metering aims to overcome these limitations by mimicking parts of the D/A conversion process, effectively up-sampling the measured signal, in order to display the true value of peaks that occur in the analog domain.\n\n\n\nTruePeak metering setup options"

As an audio engineer, you can trust your ears and the manufacturer’s data-sheets to assess the effects this chain has on the incoming audio. In a variety of cases, however, this is either simply impractical, not possible or not precise enough. Such situations include live sound setups, recording setups, etc., where unknown factors such as the venue’s or studio’s acoustic response are a crucial part of the chain.\nIt is therefore necessary to resort to scientific measurement procedures and tools to obtain precise, trustworthy and reproducible results. The main tools at your disposal for this purpose are transfer curve and impulse response measurement, which are especially designed for this task.\nAs with any measurement instrument, it is important to have a good grasp of its mode of operation as well as any possible limitations in order to use it most efficiently. Some knowledge of acoustic principles and notions of signal processing are naturally required as well. While this manual tries to cover most typical use cases and point out common do’s and dont’s, it obviously cannot replace neither a good textbook nor practical experience."

Both source and response are recorded and monitored by the analyzer, from which several measurement curves are produced.\nThe first step is therefore to setup the measurement chain. In cases where an outboard or plugin device’s characteristics are to be measured, this is just a matter of routing the inputs and outputs in your DAW.\nIf you’re measuring the acoustic response of a physical space, you’ll need to place at least one microphone at the preferred listening position to record the response. The source can either be picked up directly at the DAW output or recorded with a second microphone placed in front of the loudspeaker(s), depending on whether you want to include the loudspeaker’s influence or not in the measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSystem analysis overall principle."

As always, the goal is to set the test signal as high as possible above the noise floor while ensuring all devices still operate in their linear region. Finally, make sure the microphone is firmly held in position and acoustically decoupled from the floor.\nIn a live concert context, especially with the audience present, using a noise signal is not practical. In this case you can still perform measurements, using a music signal, but the measurements will be less accurate as the signal isn’t known in advance and does not necessarily contain all frequencies like noise does."

While these type of signals are those that give the best and more accurate results, with each having its own strength and weaknesses, they do prohibit the measurement of a system in the context of a live system with the audience present.\nPerforming measurements using a live music signal allows the engineer to fine tune the system settings to compensate for changing conditions such as the effect of the crowd on acoustic reflections and damping, varying temperature and humidity, etc. Although less pleasing to the ear, we do however recommend using a noise test signal whenever possible, at least as a starting point.\nYou are free to use any kind of test signal generator, outboard or plugin, provided you trust it being reliable and easy to use. A selection of plugins suitable for this task is shown in the chart below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile Pure Analyzer does not impose any limitation on the test signal used, we recommend using the integrated Signal generator 71, which has been especially designed for this task.
