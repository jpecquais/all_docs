    "text": "In a conventional digital system, audio material is captured, stored, transmitted and reproduced as a sequence of values, which correspond to the amplitude variations of an electric signal at discrete points in time. Our ability to extract meaningful information from this raw data through either hearing or visualization of the signal curve is however somewhat limited to emotional interpretation, which as one may expect, is extremely subjective.\nExtensive studies have shown that first converting this data to a so-called frequency representation is extremely useful for a broad range of audio applications, as it is quite similar in principle to the human auditory system. A proper detailed explanation of the reasons behind this is well outside of the scope of this manual, so we will only hint at a few important characteristics of human hearing, namely its\n\nability to recognize and isolate sounds base on their relative intensity or loudness\nability to identify a pitch and timbre (color, texture) for sounds that fall in this category\nability to distinguish sounds based on their actual or perceived location\n\nA number of methods have been invented in order to translate these characteristics to measurable quantities that can be expressed in standardized units. These provide invaluable tools for assessing the quality of an audio recording, assisting the engineer in detecting potential mix problems, conforming to industry standards and requirements, calibrating loudspeaker systems, tuning room acoustics, etc.\nA fundamental tool for transforming a time-based digital audio signal into a frequency-based representation, a.k.a frequency spectrum, is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its derivatives, such as the Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Basically, the DFT maps a signal to a set of amplitudes taken at equally-spaced frequency intervals. In essence, one can see the DFT as a bank of many band-pass filters, with as many meters at the output of these filters.\nWhilst constraining the frequencies to be taken at fixed, regular intervals, is convenient both in terms of processing resources and simplicity of the computation, amongst other reasons, this linear frequency binning does not represent human hearing, which is essentially logarithmic (constant Q), very accurately. The analysis engine in Pure Analyzer therefore offers both options, which are discussed in more detail in Spectrum analyzer."

    "text": "Pure Analyzer System completely separates signal acquisition from analysis for maximum flexibility.\nSource and response signals are first acquired by the SampleGrabber plugin and subsequently routed across the network using the ZeroConf/Apple Bonjour protocol. Finally, the Pure Analyzer standalone application receives the sample feed(s) and analyzes them.\nSampleGrabber is a surround-capable plugin, available in all common format (VST, AU, RTAS and TDM), whose channel configuration is set automatically, or by clicking the  icon and setting the desired channel count in the I/O sub-menu.\nThe Pure Analyzer application displays in the Audio source menu a list of SampleGrabber instances found on the network . Each instance is identified by the associated computer network name it is running on. Clicking a name in the list selects the corresponding SampleGrabber for input.\n\nYou can insert up to 64 instances of SampleGrabber plugins inside one same DAW, and up to 64 Pure Analyzer instances can be connected to any SampleGrabber instance over the network. A SampleGrabber can be connected to up to 64 Pure Analyzer instances over the network. We do however recommend to limit the number of instances in order to avoid saturating the network."

Should you encounter any problems with your connection, we advise you to check whether the UDP port range from 46000 to 46064 is opened in your firewall, for both incoming and outgoing connections.\nThe audio transport requires approximately 1.4Mbps for each channel at a sample rate of 44.1kHz, whereas a 5.1 configuration at 96kHz demands a little less than 20Mbps. A properly functioning standard Ethernet 100Mbps network should therefore be more than sufficient to handle most scenarios.\n\nThe above bandwidth requirements naturally do not apply when using both SampleGrabber and Pure Analyzer on the same machine.\nPlease check with your network administrator if you have any bandwidth issues and/or special requirements."

This mode is therefore useful to get a very steady picture of the spectrum while still monitoring some of the mid-term changes, and saves you from holding and resetting the display manually again and again."

This value constitutes a good compromise between precision and responsiveness for most situations.

    "text": "The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is the traditional method employed to compute the frequency spectrum of a discrete digital signal. DFT can be seen as a series of notch filters centered around frequency bins that are uniformly distributed along the frequency axis, and of constant width.\nThe quality factor of a resonant filter, commonly denoted as Q, is defined as the ratio of its bandwidth relative to its center frequency. The DFT process is therefore analogous to a variable Q filter-bank: in other words, its frequency resolution is constant across the spectrum. When applied to sliding blocks, this process is called STFT, for Short-term Fourier transform.\nAlthough convenient in terms of computation, this can be seen as less than ideal for many audio applications, for several reasons, the first and foremost being that human perception of frequency is known to be quasi-logarithmic. Logarithmic means that a two-fold increase in frequency translates to a one octave shift, a four-fold increase as a two-octave shift - and not four as this would be the case, were our perception linear in nature.\nPure Analyzer employs both standard DFT and proprietary algorithms that more closely model the human perception. In addition to greatly improving the legibility of the resulting curves, this proprietary transform has the additional benefit of reducing sensitivity to noise in the high-frequency portion of the spectrum especially, and provides more stable readouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can of course switch back to standard DFT by disengaging the Pure spectrum button."

Also, note that plain DFT corresponds to scaling set to amplitude.\nThe power of a time-signal is proportional to the square of its amplitude, or equivalently, its power in dB is double the amplitude. However, in the case of a spectrum, we are measuring the output of a filter-bank, which reacts very much differently depending on the type of input signal, so the simple previous formula doesn’t apply anymore."

    "text": "Nebula / Spatial Spectrogram provides a unique representation of the audio material in terms of spectral content and localization in the stereo and/or surround space. Its combines the functionality of a spectrum analyzer and a vector scope in a novel real-time display. As such it provides to be an invaluable tool to get a complete and detailed overview of your mix, which you can finely tune in many aspects to suit your particular needs and preferences. A lot of work has gone into optimizing the real-time rendering of the display, not solely for aesthetic reasons, but because we wanted the display to react instantly to all the details in the incoming audio. The idea is literally for you to be able to see what you hear and feel, and not some gross simplification wrapped into shiny eye-candy, however pleasing to the eye.\nThe overall principles behind Nebula / Spatial Spectrogram are quite straightforward:\n\nAt any given time, and for every frequency, the engine computes the position of a frequency in space (2D in stereo , ND for N channel-surround). This position is taken as the center of gravity of the various channels, weighted by the relative amplitude of the signal in their corresponding channel.\nA projection onto an LR-spectrum plane is computed, giving a spectrum-space frame constrained to the stereo field.\nIncoming spectrum-space frames are added back to the previous frames.\nPast frames are progressively “forgotten”, using blur and dimming, in order to make place for new information, and increase legibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebula / Spatial Spectrogram display with stereo input\nNebula / Spatial Spectrogram display with surround input\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNebula / Spatial Spectrogram setup options"

    "text": "All digital audio wave signals are ultimately converted back to analog at some point, and while it is often desirable to maximize the overall volume of a signal or a complete mix, care must be taken in order not to go above the digital scale zero decibel ceiling, or nasty distortion and clipping will occur. This common and widely used rule is however not entirely sufficient, as the digital and analog processing involved in a D/A converter does not guarantee that a 0dBfs peak signal will exactly translate to a 0dB peak in the analog domain.\nWithout getting into too much detail, this phenomenon can be attributed to the over-sampling and reconstruction filters present in the D/A convertors, whose role are to rebuild a continuous time signal from a set of discrete digital values sampled at regularly spaced time intervals. This interpolation process can therefore generate values which lie above 0dB, which is known as overshoot.\nRelying solely on the peak value of samples can lead to the following problems:\n\nInconsistent readings between successive playbacks of the same material.\nUnexpected overloads of the D/A output converter.\nUnder-readings and beating of pure tones.\n\nTruePeak metering aims to overcome these limitations by mimicking parts of the D/A conversion process, effectively up-sampling the measured signal, in order to display the true value of peaks that occur in the analog domain.\n\n\n\nTruePeak metering setup options"

    "text": "At first glance, an audio signal chain is very much like a series of black boxes. As an audio engineer, you can trust your ears and the manufacturer’s data-sheets to assess the effects this chain has on the incoming audio. In a variety of cases, however, this is either simply impractical, not possible or not precise enough. Such situations include live sound setups, recording setups, etc., where unknown factors such as the venue’s or studio’s acoustic response are a crucial part of the chain.\nIt is therefore necessary to resort to scientific measurement procedures and tools to obtain precise, trustworthy and reproducible results. The main tools at your disposal for this purpose are transfer curve and impulse response measurement, which are especially designed for this task.\nAs with any measurement instrument, it is important to have a good grasp of its mode of operation as well as any possible limitations in order to use it most efficiently. Some knowledge of acoustic principles and notions of signal processing are naturally required as well. While this manual tries to cover most typical use cases and point out common do’s and dont’s, it obviously cannot replace neither a good textbook nor practical experience."

This system input is fed with a source signal, which produces a response signal at its output(s). Both source and response are recorded and monitored by the analyzer, from which several measurement curves are produced.\nThe first step is therefore to setup the measurement chain. In cases where an outboard or plugin device’s characteristics are to be measured, this is just a matter of routing the inputs and outputs in your DAW.\nIf you’re measuring the acoustic response of a physical space, you’ll need to place at least one microphone at the preferred listening position to record the response. The source can either be picked up directly at the DAW output or recorded with a second microphone placed in front of the loudspeaker(s), depending on whether you want to include the loudspeaker’s influence or not in the measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSystem analysis overall principle."

In this case you can still perform measurements, using a music signal, but the measurements will be less accurate as the signal isn’t known in advance and does not necessarily contain all frequencies like noise does."

While these type of signals are those that give the best and more accurate results, with each having its own strength and weaknesses, they do prohibit the measurement of a system in the context of a live system with the audience present.\nPerforming measurements using a live music signal allows the engineer to fine tune the system settings to compensate for changing conditions such as the effect of the crowd on acoustic reflections and damping, varying temperature and humidity, etc. Although less pleasing to the ear, we do however recommend using a noise test signal whenever possible, at least as a starting point.\nYou are free to use any kind of test signal generator, outboard or plugin, provided you trust it being reliable and easy to use. A selection of plugins suitable for this task is shown in the chart below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile Pure Analyzer does not impose any limitation on the test signal used, we recommend using the integrated Signal generator 78, which has been especially designed for this task.
