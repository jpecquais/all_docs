    "text": "In a conventional digital system, audio material is captured, stored, transmitted and reproduced as a sequence of values, which correspond to the amplitude variations of an electric signal at discrete points in time. Our ability to extract meaningful information from this raw data through either hearing or visualization of the signal curve is however somewhat limited to emotional interpretation, which as one may expect, is extremely subjective.\nExtensive studies have shown that first converting this data to a so-called frequency representation is extremely useful for a broad range of audio applications, as it is quite similar in principle to the human auditory system. A proper detailed explanation of the reasons behind this is well outside of the scope of this manual, so we will only hint at a few important characteristics of human hearing, namely its\n\nability to recognize and isolate sounds base on their relative intensity or loudness\nability to identify a pitch and timbre (color, texture) for sounds that fall in this category\nability to distinguish sounds based on their actual or perceived location\n\nA number of methods have been invented in order to translate these characteristics to measurable quantities that can be expressed in standardized units. These provide invaluable tools for assessing the quality of an audio recording, assisting the engineer in detecting potential mix problems, conforming to industry standards and requirements, calibrating loudspeaker systems, tuning room acoustics, etc.\nA fundamental tool for transforming a time-based digital audio signal into a frequency-based representation, a.k.a frequency spectrum, is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its derivatives, such as the Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Basically, the DFT maps a signal to a set of amplitudes taken at equally-spaced frequency intervals. In essence, one can see the DFT as a bank of many band-pass filters, with as many meters at the output of these filters.\nWhilst constraining the frequencies to be taken at fixed, regular intervals, is convenient both in terms of processing resources and simplicity of the computation, amongst other reasons, this linear frequency binning does not represent human hearing, which is essentially logarithmic (constant Q), very accurately. The analysis engine in Pure Analyzer therefore offers both options, which are discussed in more detail in Spectrum analyzer."

    "text": "1.1 Principle of operation\nPure Analyzer System completely separates signal acquisition from analysis for maximum flexibility.\nSource and response signals are first acquired by the SampleGrabber plugin and subsequently routed across the network using the ZeroConf/Apple Bonjour protocol. Finally, the Pure Analyzer standalone application receives the sample feed(s) and analyzes them.\nSampleGrabber is a surround-capable plugin, available in all common format (VST, AU, RTAS and TDM), whose channel configuration is set automatically, or by clicking the  icon and setting the desired channel count in the I/O sub-menu.\nThe Pure Analyzer application displays in the Audio source menu a list of SampleGrabber instances found on the network . Each instance is identified by the associated computer network name it is running on. Clicking a name in the list selects the corresponding SampleGrabber for input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can insert up to 64 instances of SampleGrabber plugins inside one same DAW, and up to 64 Pure Analyzer instances can be connected to any SampleGrabber instance over the network. A SampleGrabber can be connected to up to 64 Pure Analyzer instances over the network. We do however recommend to limit the number of instances in order to avoid saturating the network."

Should you encounter any problems with your connection, we advise you to check whether the UDP port range from 46000 to 46064 is opened in your firewall, for both incoming and outgoing connections.\nThe audio transport requires approximately 1.4Mbps for each channel at a sample rate of 44.1kHz, whereas a 5.1 configuration at 96kHz demands a little less than 20Mbps. A properly functioning standard Ethernet 100Mbps network should therefore be more than sufficient to handle most scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe above bandwidth requirements naturally do not apply when using both SampleGrabber and Pure Analyzer on the same machine.\nPlease check with your network administrator if you have any bandwidth issues and/or special requirements."

As an audio engineer, you can trust your ears and the manufacturer’s data-sheets to assess the effects this chain has on the incoming audio. In a variety of cases, however, this is either simply impractical, not possible or not precise enough. Such situations include live sound setups, recording setups, etc., where unknown factors such as the venue’s or studio’s acoustic response are a crucial part of the chain.\nIt is therefore necessary to resort to scientific measurement procedures and tools to obtain precise, trustworthy and reproducible results. The main tools at your disposal for this purpose are transfer curve and impulse response measurement, which are especially designed for this task.\nAs with any measurement instrument, it is important to have a good grasp of its mode of operation as well as any possible limitations in order to use it most efficiently. Some knowledge of acoustic principles and notions of signal processing are naturally required as well. While this manual tries to cover most typical use cases and point out common do’s and dont’s, it obviously cannot replace neither a good textbook nor practical experience."

Transforming an audio signal onto a frequency scale is indeed of great interest in a wide range of tasks, and notably allows to display a global, perceptually meaningful and precise picture of the audio contents.\nThe display represents the so-called magnitude spectrum of the incoming signal, which is a two-dimensional curve of the magnitudes of the signal taken at frequencies ranging from 0 (DC) to half that of the current sampling rate (or Nyquist frequency in signal processing jargon).

    "section": "12.2 Settings",
    "text": "12.2 Settings\n\nBlock size\nKeep in mind that the incoming audio needs to be accumulated in a buffer for a certain amount of time before the data can be computed and the display updated. In contrast with the buffers you probably know from soundcards, this block-processing is not just a computer technicality and only a source of undesirable latency, but an integral part of the process related to the mathematical aspects involved (Time-frequency product uncertainty principle).\nAs such, it determines both the precision of the analysis and the maximum display rate, and should be adjusted depending on the specifics of your application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn order to maintain a sufficiently responsive display refresh rate, blocks overlap by 75 %.\nThe default setting is 8192 samples, which corresponds to a length of roughly 180ms at 44.1kHz sampling rate. This value constitutes a good compromise between precision and responsiveness for most situations. However, if you need to measure a particular frequency with great precision, you should raise the analysis block size. On the other hand, if you need to follow rapid spectrum variations, this value should be lowered.\n\n\n\n\nTransform type\nThe discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is the traditional method employed to compute the frequency spectrum of a discrete digital signal. DFT can be seen as a series of notch filters centered around frequency bins that are uniformly distributed along the frequency axis, and of constant width.\nThe quality factor of a resonant filter, commonly denoted as Q, is defined as the ratio of its bandwidth relative to its center frequency. The DFT process is therefore analogous to a variable Q filter-bank: in other words, its frequency resolution is constant across the spectrum. When applied to sliding blocks, this process is called STFT, for Short-term Fourier transform.\nAlthough convenient in terms of computation, this can be seen as less than ideal for many audio applications, for several reasons, the first and foremost being that human perception of frequency is known to be quasi-logarithmic. Logarithmic means that a two-fold increase in frequency translates to a one octave shift, a four-fold increase as a two-octave shift - and not four as this would be the case, were our perception linear in nature.\nPure Analyzer employs both standard DFT and proprietary algorithms that more closely model the human perception. In addition to greatly improving the legibility of the resulting curves, this proprietary transform has the additional benefit of reducing sensitivity to noise in the high-frequency portion of the spectrum especially, and provides more stable readouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can of course switch back to standard DFT by disengaging the Pure spectrum button.\n\n\n\n\nWindow type\nAs previously mentioned, the first step is to split the incoming signal into overlapping blocks. Each block is then multiplied with a so-called window signal prior to the spectrum computation. The purpose of this is to minimize side effects of the block processing, such as introduction of transients at the block boundaries, etc.\nThe window type to use is set in the Main 5 setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe suggest you leave this setting to the default unless you are quite knowledgeable with these aspects, or in the case you should need to explicitly recreate a specific measurement such as a particular method specified in a standard’s document.\n\n\nThe Wikipedia entry on window functions in the context of signal processing is a good reference if you want to get a more thorough understanding of the subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile the windowing process is implemented in the time-domain, it can be also be seen as a smoothing filter in the frequency domain, and as such the choice of window is a compromise between frequency resolution and immunity to artifacts. Skipping the windowing process altogether, which is the same as applying a rectangular window, is not recommended. Although the rectangular window provides the best frequency resolution, it has very poor leakage characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nBallistics\nThe curve display update speed is controlled by the ballistics settings.\n\nRelease time\nThe release time determines how fast the main curve falls back to zero. Default is 300ms.\n\n\nMax release time\nThe controls the release time of the optional Max curve, which serves to display the medium-to-long term tendency of the magnitude spectrum. Longer times mean curve maxima/peaks will be seen for a longer period.\nDefault is 50 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe attack time is zero so the curve displays reacts instantaneously to a rising amplitude.\n\n\n\n\n\nAveraging\nThis is a global setting controlled in the Averaging section of the main setup.\n\n\nFrequency scaling\nScaling controls how the scaling applied to spectrum magnitudes. This is a global setting accessed through the Main 5 setup panel.\nScaling controls whether frequency-dependent amplitude scaling should be applied. This affects how various standard reference signals register on the display. The default power scaling will result in a signal with spectrum components of constant power registering as a flat curve, whilst amplitude will have the same effect for components of constant amplitude such as pure tones (sine signal).\nThe table below shows how the curve appearance depending on the type of input signal. 1/f corresponds to a rectilinear slope on the display with both X and Y axis being logarithmic.\n\n\n\nInput signal\nSine\nWhite\nPink noise\n\n\n\n\nPower scaling\n1/f\n1/f\nFlat\n\n\nAmplitude scaling\nFlat\nFlat\n1/f\n\n\n\nFor monitoring a mix, it makes most sense to use power scaling, as this is the way our hearing responds. If you need to measure a room’s acoustic response, an outboard unit or a plugin’s frequency response, the system magnitude transfer function is best suited for this purpose and scaling has no effect.\nThe amplitude scaling setting should therefore really be employed if you need to measure relative amplitude values, such as those of sine test tones at various frequencies. Also, note that plain DFT corresponds to scaling set to amplitude.\nThe power of a time-signal is proportional to the square of its amplitude, or equivalently, its power in dB is double the amplitude. However, in the case of a spectrum, we are measuring the output of a filter-bank, which reacts very much differently depending on the type of input signal, so the simple previous formula doesn’t apply anymore.\n\n\nDisplay range\nDisplay range can be switched from a fixed reference interval to one that automatically adjusts to the current range of spectrum magnitude values. The latter is useful as a set and forget setting and works well to display the most vertical detail, at the expense of losing the ability to visually compare the current values to a reference level.\n\ndB Min / dB Max\nSets the minimum and maximum magnitude to display, in decibels. This is visible the range of the display that is taken into account when auto-range is off.\nDefault range is -18dB (min) to -114dB (max).\n\n\nRange mode\nDefault is Manual.\nManual\nUses a fixed range as specified by the above settings.\n\nAuto\nWhen engaged, auto-range continuously adjusts the display to the current range of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA slight envelope is applied to the auto-range values in order to improve legibility, avoiding the display to follow every minor change. Peaks are always registered however, as these provide valuable information that should not be missed.\n\n\nCompressed\nThe range is defined by dB Min/Max values, and the Y-axis is also compressed in the lower range. This can bring out peaks and valleys in the spectrum to better visualize resonant frequencies and such.\n\nCompressed | Auto\nCombines Compressed and Auto modes.\n\n\n\nSummation\nThese settings allow you to modify the appearance of the curves in channel sum mode.\n\nFilled\nToggles whether the main curve is drawn as a solid-color fill or a plain line.\nDefault is on.\n\n\nWidth\nThickness of the pen used to draw the curve lines, in pixels.\nDefault is 1.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis setting also affects individual curves when channel sum mode is disabled.\n\n\n\n\nFull curve color\nColor of the pen used to draw the main, full-detail, unsmoothed curve.\n\n\nSmoothed curve color\nColor of the pen used to draw the smoothed curve.\n\n\nMax curve color\nColor of the pen used to draw the max curve.\n\n\nColor grading\nApplies an optional frequency-dependent coloring to the main channel-sum curve.\n\nMagnitude spectrum with color grading enabled\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen enabled, any of the above fixed color settings are overridden.\n\n\n\n\n\nChannels\nThis group of settings controls the appearance of curves when channel sum mode is disabled.

    "text": "14.1 Principle of operation\nNebula / Spatial Spectrogram provides a unique representation of the audio material in terms of spectral content and localization in the stereo and/or surround space. Its combines the functionality of a spectrum analyzer and a vector scope in a novel real-time display. As such it provides to be an invaluable tool to get a complete and detailed overview of your mix, which you can finely tune in many aspects to suit your particular needs and preferences. A lot of work has gone into optimizing the real-time rendering of the display, not solely for aesthetic reasons, but because we wanted the display to react instantly to all the details in the incoming audio. The idea is literally for you to be able to see what you hear and feel, and not some gross simplification wrapped into shiny eye-candy, however pleasing to the eye.\nThe overall principles behind Nebula / Spatial Spectrogram are quite straightforward:\n\nAt any given time, and for every frequency, the engine computes the position of a frequency in space (2D in stereo , ND for N channel-surround). This position is taken as the center of gravity of the various channels, weighted by the relative amplitude of the signal in their corresponding channel.\nA projection onto an LR-spectrum plane is computed, giving a spectrum-space frame constrained to the stereo field.\nIncoming spectrum-space frames are added back to the previous frames.\nPast frames are progressively “forgotten”, using blur and dimming, in order to make place for new information, and increase legibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebula / Spatial Spectrogram display with stereo input\nNebula / Spatial Spectrogram display with surround input\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNebula / Spatial Spectrogram setup options"

    "text": "19.3 Dolby Dialogue Intelligence\n\nIntroduction\nWhile EBU R128 aims to measure global perceived loudness, irrespectively of the audio material, Dolby Dialogue Intelligence is a patented technology designed to specifically measure the perceived loudness of dialogue elements in the audio. It is therefore targeted towards broadcast applications.\n\n\nGeneral principle\nDialogue Intelligence replaces EBU R128’s level-based gate with a speech-content ratio based gate. The algorithm computes several low-level features for the incoming signal in speech channels. These are then combined into an overall speech percentage figure. When speech content is detected, Integrated Loudness is computed from the speech channels which have a speech content ratio above a certain threshold.\nWhen other material is detected, i.e. not speech, standard EBU R128 Integrated Loudness computation is employed.\n\n\nDisplay\nThe current speech content is displayed as text below the current gate status.\nAdditionally, color coding indicates the speech content ratio.\n\nSpeech : speech content present\nGreen: high speech content\nOrange: medium speech content\nRed: low speech content\nOther: other material present\n\n\n\nDelay and compensation\nThe sophistication of the algorithms employed in Dialogue Intelligence incurs an overall latency of 2048ms (approx. 2s).\nWhen Dialogue Intelligence is enabled, the display of other Loudness values is compensated to make sure meter readings are consistent. Other real-time meter (RMS, TruePeak) displays are not compensated, as we feel in this case maintaining the best reactivity to the incoming signal is more important.\nAll meter statistics are time-aligned.\n\n\nSurround\nChannels taken into account by the algorithm are determined based on the current channel configuration.\nFor mono/stereo signals, all channels are taken into account. For surround configurations, only Left/Right and Center channels are taken into account, if present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDialogue Intelligence computation only affects I (Integrated) Loudness values.\nToggling Dialogue Intelligence on and off forces a reset of the meter values.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright & patent information\nCreated under license from Dolby Laboratories Licensing Corporation.

Attempting to measure a delay greater than this will inevitably lead to corrupt measurements. The default setting is 1s, which should cover the vast majority of real-world situations, since it covers a distance of 330 meters.\n\n\nEnsure stable conditions while performing a measurement\nYou should ensure both source and response signals have reached stability before attempting measurement. In particular, do not stop or start the audio, change the volume or any other parameter just before or during measurement. This would invalidate the measurement and you would have to start again.\n\n\nLimitations\nPlease note there are many unknowns in play when determining the optimum delay figure. While we did our best to make this tool as robust and accurate as possible, as with all automatic procedures there is always a possibility that it will fail. In this case you should repeat the process or resort to manual adjustment until you get satisfactory results.\n\n\nMultiple paths\nThe major assumption behind delay compensation is that there is a main direct path from source to listener. In a very reverberant or complex-shaped acoustic space, this obviously does not apply anymore. This is where acoustics expertise and trial-and-error comes into play, in order to attain the best compromise."

It is advised to use this function sparingly though, as it can change values by a large proportion, and obscure potential problems with either the actual system being measured, or the measurement setup itself.\nA combination of time averaging and frequency smoothing is most often required to obtain readable results in real-world scenarios, especially with large rooms and outdoors.\n\nMain\n\nTF/Sweep Block size\nBlock size used for the transfer function and the snapshot done with sweep.

It is important to understand that smoothing destroys information in order to achieve this, so you should always double-check what you see on the smoothed curve against the original, raw data.\nThe algorithms employed here are specific to phase, and have more options than the regular smoothing employed for spectrum magnitude, transfer function magnitude and coherence, in case you wish to fine-tune their behaviour.\n\n\n\nDisplay\nToggles between the various phase curve display modes:\n\nFull: raw phase only.\nSmoothed: smoothed phase only.\nAll: both.\n\n\n\nWidth\nSize of the pen used to draw the phase curve.\n\n\nColor\nColor of the pen used to draw the phase curve.\n\n\nPhase Smoothing\n\nMethod\nPlease refer to Phase smoothing methods.\n\n\nDetail\nAdjusts the overall level of detail that remains after smoothing, in percent.

Conversely, regions with coherence close to one are applied little or no smoothing.\nLow-coherence regions are caused by low signal-to-noise ratio, multiple paths, etc. which cannot be accurately described in terms of a simple gain and a phase shift anyway, so it makes sense to suppress excess detail in these regions to improve the curve’s general readability.\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nAvailable phase smoothing algorithms.\nThe general principle is that for each curve pixel, the algorithm determines the amount of smoothing applied in its neighboring region, based on a threshold determined from other pixels in the region. The smoothing therefore adapts to the curve content, applying more smoothing in noisy regions.\nStdAvg/Abs was determined to be method giving the best results in the general case, and is set as default. You might still want to experiment with other algorithms, especially if you have a slow computer.\n\nFix/Abs\nThis is the simplest and least CPU-intensive phase smoothing algorithm.

This special type of snapshot automates the acquisition of transfer function and impulse response curves using a swept sine generator output.\nPlease check the following for proper operation:\n\nGenerator output -Chapter 24 should be properly assigned to the corresponding hardware channels .\nHardware IO should be properly configured and set to hardware output(s).\nSweep start/end frequencies should be set as desired.\n\nProviding the previous requirements are met, a progress dialog will then be displayed until all data has been acquired and the snapshot is computed and ready for display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEnsure the outputs of the generator and the connected speakers are set to reasonable levels in order to prevent damage to your equipment and hearing loss.\n\n\n\n\nCreate average\nClick the  button with multiple snapshots selected to create a new snapshot average of these.\nThe new snapshot curve data is computed from the selected snapshot data as follows:\n\nSpectrum magnitude: average of magnitude vectors.\nTransfer function magnitude: average of magnitude vectors.\nTransfer function phase is set to zero as there is no mathematically significant meaning to averaging of potentially unrelated phase spectra.\nTransfer function coherence: average of coherence vectors.\nImpulse response: average of signals.\n\nThe averaging can only be performed if the snapshots are compatible with one another, that is they have identical:\n\nSampling rate.\nNumber of channels.\nSpectrum type.\nImpulse response length.\n\nA warning message will inform you the averaging cannot be performed if one of the above conditions are not met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe snapshot average stores the average of the snapshots at the moment it was created.\nIf you change the snapshots in any way, the snapshot average will not change.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate current\nClicking the  button will overwrite the last selected snapshot contents with the most current data.\nThis is especially useful when you are fine-tuning your measurement setup and only want to keep the latest one, without creating several snapshots and deleting them afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis function is destructive: there is no means to revert the original snapshot data.\n\n\n\n\nLoad project\nOpens a dialog box where you can select an existing folder containing a previously saved project.\nTo create a new empty project, creating a new folder and name it, then selecting using in this dialog.\n\n\nCurve visibility\nFor each snapshot, you can control which curve should be displayed. These controls are intended to select only those curves that you really need to be displayed when there are many visible snapshots, and still maintain a legible display:\n\nTransfer function coherence.\nTransfer function magnitude.\nTransfer function phase.\nMagnitude spectrum.\nImpulse response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe default visibility of newly created curves can be customized in Display defaults.\n\n\n\n\nColor\nOpens up a color selector dialog where you can manually set the color used to identify the snapshot, both in the list and as a curve.\n\n\nName\nBy the default, newly created snapshots are given the name unlabeled-x, where x is the current number of snapshots in the project. You are strongly encouraged to edit this name for further reference.\n\n\nInvert (Iv)\nInverts the magnitude curve of the Transfer function."
