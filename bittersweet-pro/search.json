    "text": "1.1 The Ultimate Frequency Dependent Transient Designer\nBitterSweet Pro, Frequency Dependent Transient Designer, is built around a new improved design of the algorithm found in Flux:: acclaimed freeware transient processor, BitterSweet, used by hundreds of thousands of users all over the world, and the approach we had when designing BitterSweet Pro was to make it just as easy and straightforward to use.\nWith BitterSweet Pro, Transients and Sustain can be amplified or attenuated simultaneously or individually, and it can process either all components (Main) in one, or process the Mid (Center) or the Side (Stereo) parts of the sound independently by encoding the material with its internal MS encoder, process it, and then decode it back to stereo again. This fundamental design makes it really easy to perform powerful level-independent transparent shaping of the sound spectrum with BitterSweet Pro."
