    "text": "Elixir is the improved and revamp version of the legacy Elixir. Such as it, Elixir is a novel kind of program limiter carefully designed to accomplish a truly natural sounding result without changing the nature of the audio material and its timbre, presenting none, or effectively reduced, conventional limiting “pumping” effects even during heavy processing. Now supporting up to 32 channels, 64bits float audio processing and conforming with the ITU-R and EBU loudness norms, Elixir Essential is an indispensable tool for immersive audio productions.\nIt’s a REAL True Peak Limiter, providing a guaranteed True Peak output level according to the ITU-R-BS 1770 or the ITU-R-BS 1770-3, and EBU R128 norms. The algorithm is using an oversampled representation of the audio sample as a reference when it defines the gain envelope; still, the processing is only applied to the original none oversampled data in order to reduce artifacts (like aliasing), and to achieve the most excellent sounding result.\nWorking on 64bits audio processing when the Digital Audio Workstation supports it, Elixir is incredibly easy to achieve great results with: set the input level, adjust ‘Threshold’ according to the amount of limiting you want, and finally enable ‘Make Up’ to compensate the gain and to add loudness - That’s it! There is no need to care about release time or any other conventional limiter settings!\nThere’s an additional feature provided to increase the processing quality in Elixir called ‘Stages’. Stages present the option to set the algorithm to perform the limiting processing in multi-stages, for a limitation more natural and more respectful of the sound material.\n\nElixir Session, Elixir\nElixir comes with two different licensing options: - Elixir supports up to 32 channels and a sample rate up to 384kHz - Elixir Session supports up to 2 channels and a sample rate up to 96kHz.\nThe build is the same for both versions, the licensing allowing to use the plug-in as Elixir Session or Elixir."

    "text": "All digital audio wave signal is ultimately converted back to analog at some point, and while it is often desirable to maximize the overall volume of a signal or a complete mix, care must be taken in order not to go above the digital scale zero decibel ceiling, or nasty distortion and clipping will occur. This common and widely used rule is however not entirely sufficient, as the digital and analog processing involved in a D/A converter does not guarantee that a 0dBfs peak signal will exactly translate to a 0dB peak in the analog domain.\nWithout getting into too much detail, this phenomenon can be attributed to the over-sampling and reconstruction filters present in D/A converters, whose role are to rebuild a continuous time signal from a set of discrete digital values sampled at regularly spaced time intervals. This interpolation process can therefore generate values, which lie above 0dB, and is known as overshoot.\nRelying solely on the peak value of samples can lead to the following problems:\n\nInconsistent readings between successive playbacks of the same material.\nUnexpected overloads of the D/A output converter.\nUnder-readings and beating of pure tones.\n\nUsing True Peak value aims to overcome these limitations by mimicking parts of the D/A conversion process, effectively up-sampling the measured signal, in order to use the true value of peaks that occur in the analog domain."
