    "text": "Elixir v3 is a novel kind of program limiter carefully designed to accomplish a truly natural sounding result without changing the nature of the audio material and its timbre, presenting none, or effectively reduced, conventional limiting “pumping” effects even during heavy processing.\nIt’s a REAL True Peak Limiter, providing a guaranteed True Peak output level according to the ITU-R-BS 1770 and EBU R128 norms. The algorithm is using an oversampled representation of the audio sample as a reference when it defines the gain envelope; still, the processing is only applied to the original none oversampled data in order to reduce artifacts (like aliasing), and to achieve the most excellent sounding result.\nElixir v3 is incredibly easy to achieve great results with, simply set the input level, then adjust ‘Threshold’ according to the amount of limiting you want, and enable ‘Make Up’ to compensate the gain and to add loudness - That’s it! There is no need to care about release time or any other conventional limiter settings!\nThere’s an additional feature provided to increase the processing quality in Elixir v3 called ‘Stages’. Stages present the option to set the algorithm to perform the limiting processing in multi-stages."

    "text": "All digital audio wave signal is ultimately converted back to analog at some point, and while it is often desirable to maximize the overall volume of a signal or a complete mix, care must be taken in order not to go above the digital scale zero decibel ceiling, or nasty distortion and clipping will occur. This common and widely used rule is however not entirely sufficient, as the digital and analog processing involved in a D/A converter does not guarantee that a 0dBfs peak signal will exactly translate to a 0dB peak in the analog domain.\nWithout getting into too much detail, this phenomenon can be attributed to the over-sampling and reconstruction filters present in D/A converters, whose role are to rebuild a continuous time signal from a set of discrete digital values sampled at regularly spaced time intervals. This interpolation process can therefore generate values, which lie above 0dB, and is known as overshoot.\nRelying solely on the peak value of samples can lead to the following problems:\n\nInconsistent readings between successive playbacks of the same material.\nUnexpected overloads of the D/A output converter.\nUnder-readings and beating of pure tones.\n\nUsing True Peak value aims to overcome these limitations by mimicking parts of the D/A conversion process, effectively up-sampling the measured signal, in order to use the true value of peaks that occur in the analog domain."
