Each band is individually processed for dynamic. For every frequency band, every dynamic processing section, the compressor, the de- compressor, the expander and the de-expander features its own envelop generator including Dynamic Ratio, Peak amount parameters, L.I.D. (Level independent Detector) and its threshold adjustment. For every frequency band, a transient manager can be inserted pre or post dynamic processing. To achieve a total control on the audio signal, a MS management is available on every frequency band.\nThen all the frequency bands are summed to rebuild a wideband processed signal. A soft clipper featuring a threshold for soft knee, and a dry mix control are available.\nAlchemist gathers in a single plug-in all the Flux science about filtering and dynamic processing."

Note also that the Feed Backward mode prevents to use the external side chain because it’s the processed signal which feed the side chain. - Classic Feed Backward Medium: The integration time is 40 ms for RMS detection which is done on the output of the processor. Note also that the Feed Backward mode prevents to use the external side chain because it’s the processed signal which feed the side chain. - Classic Feed Backward Slow: The integration time is 80 ms for RMS detection which is done on the output of the processor. Note also that the Feed Backward mode prevents to use the external side chain because it’s the processed signal which feed the side chain.\nThese Feed Backward modes have been inspired by vintage hardware architectures. they create a sort of auto regulation of the processing which produces a naturally beefy sound."

It is mixed with the standard compression scheme.\n\nTake a piece of full mixed music, set the ratio to 3-4 and the compression will start working. Now set the threshold of the compressor to the maximum value, the compressor will stop working because the sound level will never reach the threshold. Then increase the L.I.D.. and you will see (and hear) the compression working again!!! Now decrease or increase the input gain (in Solera or before, as you want) and you will see that the compression will continue to work equally; it’s totally, completely independent of the sound level and depends only on Ratio, Knee and sound content. How can this be used? When you have too much dynamic in the sound, going for e.g. from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB; If you want to compress the low levels you will hear the sound “pumping” when the sound reaches the High levels and the only thing to do with standard compressor will be to increase the threshold to rescue some airiness in the sound. But when doing that the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear some sound differences (in term density, live space, grain etc…) especially when the compressor starts working. With Solera L.I.D.., adjust the threshold and ratio on the High levels to what you think OK, then increase the L.I.D.. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen now the low levels and especially the transition between Low and High levels. You can also start increasing the ratio to increase the effect. You’ll then notice that the compression will always be active but can still take care of High, loud levels (unless you set 100% L.I.D..) and make the compression very smooth and no more pumping… In addition with the Dynamic Ratio function, you’ll be able to set a constant and very natural envelop that allows to increase low levels, low frequency and to keep important transients."
