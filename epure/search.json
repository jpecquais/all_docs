Stereo or M/S encoded material as well as multichannel surround material can be processed individually, or combined in configurable explicit groups, within one single instance of Epure.\nWith the Link I/O Routing engaged, every input is automatically routed to the corresponding output, when the input routing settings are consistent. Please note that the Routing Matrix allows for routing of one input channel to several EQ-channels, as well as for routing of several EQ-channels to one output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that this is an inconsistent routing action that may in turn cause the Link I/O Routing to behave inconsistently.\nWith each Group representing one explicit EQ curve, the Group Matrix can be used to gather a number of internal EQ channels in a specific group for the combined processing of several input channels (Front/Surround, etc.).\nNote that when audio channels are grouped, the settings of the first audio channel (Channel 5 in group 2 in the above example) are applied to all channels in the group (Channels 5 & 6 in the example).\n\n\nPlease note that morphing between two parameter settings using the Morphing Slider (12) affects the settings of the Setup section as well."
